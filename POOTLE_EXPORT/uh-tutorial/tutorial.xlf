You can also plant trees later - but that costs money. Use what nature provided you with!

A company always needs a trail connection to a storage or branch office, otherwise goods will remain at the company and not be collected.

This means that you have to build a trail connecting your branch office (or storage) and lumberjack.

        <source>Those tools will be enough for the moment. Well done!

You now provide housing, a main square and food to your inhabitants.

Still there is one demand which we have not satisfied so far, you may check that in the marketplace or tent tab - your sailors want a basic building where they can pray.

The solution is a pavilion which the village parson quickly puts up as shelter from the sun.

Service buildings like this also need to be connected to the tents with a trail, else your inhabitants feel unable to reach them.

In later increments, upgraded versions of buildings may become available.</source>

It is NOT enough that the building is merely within a certain range of the tents.

        <source>Did you watch your lumberjack recently?

Since your branch office does not have unlimited space to store goods, collectors will stop fetching goods from companies when stock is full.
So if no sailor recently wanted to upgrade his tent, you probably have a lot of boards and in that case, the lumberjack may idle.
We can improve this situation with two different approaches, and below we will have a look at both of them.

All companies offer the possibility of doing no work at all.
This may sound strange, but try to click on the gear wheel you see in, for example, a lumberjack's overview.
